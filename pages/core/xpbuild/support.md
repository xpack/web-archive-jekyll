## Quicklinks

The quick answer is to use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/discussions/).

## Check the documentation

Read carefully the xpbuild [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpbuild/).

## Check the FAQ

Check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpbuild/faq/) for similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Discussions

Check the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/discussions/)
for similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Issues

Check the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/discussions/).

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug in **xpbuild**
(if you have doubts, use GitHub Discussions),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance **xpbuild**,
register a **New Issue** in the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack/xpbuild-js/issues/) tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support, **use GitHub Discussions**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use GitHub Discussions**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since GitHub Discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
