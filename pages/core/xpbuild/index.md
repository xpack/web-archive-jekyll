## Overview

This tool is still work in progress and is not yet public.

It was initially called `xmake`, but the name collided with the
_Lua xmake_, and it was re-branded.

The tool is mostly functional, at the moment it is able to build projects
using either `make` or `ninja`. Due to the uncertainty with the name,
promotion was postponed; then it was decided to also include an internal
builder,
using the code of xpninja, and to make it public when ready.
