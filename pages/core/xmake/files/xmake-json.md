## Overview

The `xmake.json` file defines the metadata required by the xmake build process.

This file is used in two contexts:

- when located in the project root, or in a test folder, this file
defines how to build the artefact (executable or library); it must
have a mandatory `name` field.
- when located in sub-folders, it is simpler and it defines build
details specific to
the sub-folder, usually compiler options and/or symbols.

{% include note.html content="Some sections may not strictly apply to the
`xmake.json` file and should be moved to a more general document about xmake." %}

## Lower case names

All names must be composed from letters, hyphens, or digits. When used to create
paths, case is not significative and all letters are converted to lower case.

## Paths

All paths use the POSIX syntax, with `/` separators.


## Macros

In certain places, strings may contain macros, with the following syntax:

```bash
${expression}
```

where _expression_ may be a name or a qualified name, like `test.name`.

## Add/remove

Generally definitions are organised hierarchically
(top/target/toolchain/profile), with each child
being able to contribute new, more specific definitions, to the parent.

For each level, definitions are kept in an ordered list. The common use case is to
copy definitions from the parent and add new definitions to the end of the
list.

If a definition from the parent is definitely not wanted, the child can
decide not to copy it, using the `removeXxx` properties.

## Build tree

The build tree is constructed of nodes. Nodes refer to folders or files;
the build tree hierarchy follows the file system hierarchy.

Folder nodes may have other folders or file as children.

The build tree is constructed for each build configuration, i.e. for each
target/profile/toolchain.

Each new depth level may contribute additional compiler options to the build,
and files located deeper in the hierarchy may be compiled with different
definitions (options, symbols, includes, etc).

## Project and/or test folders

To identify a folder as an xmake project, a full `xmake.json` file,
which includes the `name` field, is expected in the project root.

Tests are a specific kind of executable projects, and are identified
by an `xmake.json` in each test folder.

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "name": "xyz",
  "artefact": {
    "type": "executable",
    "name": "${build.name}",
    "outputPrefix": "",
    "outputSuffix": "",
    "extension": ""
  },
  "generator": "make",
  "commands": {
    "build": [ "make" ],
    "run": [ "./${artefact.fullName}" ]
  },
  "addSourceFolders": [
    "src"
  ],
  "addSymbols": [
    "GNU_SOURCE"
  ],
  "addIncludeFolders": [
    "include"
  ],
  "targets": {
    "darwin": { ... },
    "stm32f4-discovery": { ... }
  },
  "sourceFolderSettings": { ... },
  "sourceFilesSettings": { ... }
}
```

## Version

Type: string.

This semver string identifies the expected structure of the JSON content.

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

It is mandatory for all `xmake.json` files. A recent version of the
xmake tools should be prepared to parse all older version of the
`xmake.json` files. An old version of the xmake tools
should throw an error when asked to process a newer, incompatible
version of `xmake.json` file.

## Name

Type: string.

This string defines the build name. It is mandatory for projects and
for tests.

```json
{
  "name": "xyz"
}
```

## artefact

Type: object.

It can be used only in project or test `xmake.json` files; using it in folder
specific metadata files triggers an warning.

The `artefact` object defines the type and name of the output file.

The `type` property can be one of:

- `executable` (default)
- `staticLib` (default extension is `.a`)
- `sharedLib` (default extension is `.so` for Linux)

The `name` property defaults to the test name. It may include the macros
`${build.name}` or `${test.name}`. If not present, it defaults to the
mandatory project or test name.

The `artefact` object may be defined at top level, or for a given
target/profile. Each definition is searched hierarchically, bottom-up;
if present in the profile, it is used, otherwise the parent definition
it is used; if none is defined, a default is applied.

```json
{
  "artefact": {
    "type": "executable",
    "name": "${test.name}",
    "outputPrefix": "",
    "outputSuffix": "",
    "extension": ""
  }
}
```

## Generator

Type: string.

It can be used only in project or test `xmake.json` files; using it in folder
specific metadata files triggers an warning.

This string identifies the generator used to create the project.

```json
{
  "generator": "make"
}
```

Currently only `make` is supported, but generators for Eclipse
managed projects are planned.

## Commands

Type: object.

It can be used only in project or test `xmake.json` files; using it in folder
specific metadata files triggers an warning.

The `commands` object associates external commands to different actions.

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "build": [ "make" ],
    "run": [ "./${artefact.fullName}" ]
  }
}
```

The actions are identified as object properties; the values are
arrays of strings with command lines.

When serialised, the values are string arrays; when parsed, the
values may be strings, parsed as multiple words separated by spaces.

The `build` command is used to start the actual builder, after
the build files were generated.

The `run` command is used to run a test, after a successful build.
If the `run` command is missing in a test configuration, the test is
considered _build only_.

## Source folders

Type: array of strings.

This array defines the paths to the folders containing source files.
All paths are relative to the current folder.

Source folders can be defined hierarchically (top/target/profile/toolchain),
for all configurations or for a specific target/profile/toolchain.

Definitions are cumulative, each may remove/add entries to the parent array.

For tests, which are located deeper in the file system hierarchy,
a typical configuration is:

```json
{
  "addSourceFolders": [
    "../../src",
    "."
  ]
}
```

If a definition from the parent is definitely not wanted, it can be removed:

```json
{
  "removeSourceFolders": [
    "lib"
  ]
}
```

If the definitions to be removed did not exist, warnings are issued.

For a given build, all source folders are searched for source files,
possible exclusions from `sourceFolderSettings` are processed, and the
remaining files enter the build.

If, for a given profile, this array ends up empty, and the current
folder includes a `package.json`, the
`directories.src` definition (an array of strings), if present, is used.
Otherwise, if the `src` folder is present, it is used; if not, the current
folder is used.

When serialised, the values are string arrays; when parsed, the values
may be strings, parsed as multiple words separated by spaces.

## Symbols

Type: array of strings.

This array defines symbols to be passed to the compiler preprocessor.
Simple names or pairs of names and values are accepted.

```json
{
  "addSymbols": [
    "GNU_SOURCE",
    "NAME=value"
  ]
}
```

Definitions are cumulative, each may remove/add entries to the parent array.

If a definition from the parent is definitely not wanted, it can be removed:

```json
{
  "removeSymbols": [
    "GNU_SOURCE"
  ]
}
```

If the definitions to be removed did not exist, warnings are issued.

When serialised, the values are string arrays; when parsed, the values
may be strings, parsed as multiple words separated by spaces.

## Include folders

Type: array of strings.

This array defines the folders to be passed to the compiler as include
folders. All paths are relative to the current folder.

Include folders can be defined hierarchically (top/target/profile/toolchain),
for all configurations or for a specific target/profile/toolchain.

Definitions are cumulative, each may remove/add entries to the parent array.

```json
{
  "addIncludeFolders": [
    "include/xyz"
  ]
}
```

If a definition from the parent is definitely not wanted, it can be removed:

```json
{
  "removeIncludeFolders": [
    "include/abc"
  ]
}
```

If the definitions to be removed did not exist, warnings are issued.

If, for a given profile, this array ends up empty, and the current
folder includes a `package.json`, the
`directories.include` definition (an array of strings), if present, is used.
Otherwise, if the `include` folder is present, it is used; if not, the current
folder is used.

When generating the build files, relative paths from the build folder
to the actual files are created.

When serialised, the values are string arrays; when parsed, the values
may be strings, parsed as multiple words separated by spaces.

## Targets

Type: object.

The `targets` object defines the possible targets, or platforms, the
artefact is to be build for.

Each target may include several profiles.

Each target may contribute its own specific definitions to the common
definitions.

```json
{
  "targets": {
    "darwin": {
      "artefact": { ... },
      "excludedPaths": [ ... ],
      "removeSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "addSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "removeSymbols": [ ... ],
      "addSymbols": [ ... ],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "addIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "toolchains": { ... },
    },
    "stm32f4-discovery": {
      "crossBuildPlatforms": [
        "darwin", "linux", "windows"
      ],
      "artefact": { ... },
      "excludedPaths": [ ... ],
      "removeSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "addSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "removeSymbols": [ ... ],
      "addSymbols": [ ... ],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "addIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "toolchains": { ... },
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `excludedPaths` array defines folders and/or files that should
not be part of the build, for a specific target.

Target names are predefined strings.

TODO: explain where target names come from.

## Toolchains

Type: object.

The `toolchains` object defines the command line options used for each compiler.

Each toolchain may contribute its own specific definitions to the common
definitions.

```json
{
  "toolchains": {
    "gcc": {
      "artefact": { ... },
      "excludedPaths": [ ... ],
      "removeSourceFolders": [... ],
      "addSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "removeSymbols": [ ... ],
      "addSymbols": [ ... ],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "addIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "common": { ... },
      "tools": { ... },
      "profiles": { ... }
    },
    "arm-none-eabi-gcc": {
      "artefact": { ... },
      "excludedPaths": [ ... ],
      "removeSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "addSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "removeSymbols": [ ... ],
      "addSymbols": [ ... ],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "addIncludeFolders": [ ... ],
      "common": { ... },
      "tools": { ... },
      "profiles": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

The `excludedPaths` array defines folders and/or files that should
not be part of the build, for a specific toolchain.

Toolchain names are predefined strings.

TODO: explain where Toolchain names come from.

## Common

Type: object.

The `common` object defines settings common for all tools.

```json
{
  "common": {
    "removeTarget": [ ... ],
    "addTarget": [ "-mcpu=cortex-m3" ],
    "removeDebugging": [ "-g3" ],
    "addDebugging": [ "-g3" ],
    "removeOptimizations": [ ... ],
    "addOptimizations": [ "-O3" ],
    "removeWarnings": [ "-Wall" ],
    "addWarnings": [ "-Wall" ],
    "removeMiscellaneous": [ ... ],
    "addMiscellaneous": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

## Tools

Type: object.

The `tools` object defines specific settings for one or more tools.
When applied to a file, only one tool is significative, according
to the file extension.


```json
{
  "tools": {
    "c": {
      "removeSymbols": [ ... ],
      "addSymbols": [ ... ],
      "removeIncludes": [ ... ],
      "addIncludes": [ ... ],
      "removeDebugging": [ ... ],
      "addDebugging": [ ... ],
      "removeOptimizations": [ ... ],
      "addOptimizations": [ ... ],
      "removeWarnings": [ ... ],
      "addWarnings": [ ... ],
      "removeMiscellaneous": [ ... ],
      "addMiscellaneous": [ ... ]
    }
  }
}
```

When serialised, the values are string arrays; when parsed, the values
may be strings, parsed as multiple words separated by spaces.


## Profiles

Type: object.

The `profiles` object defines the possible slightly different builds,
typically debug/release.

Each profile may contribute its own specific definitions to the common
definitions.

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "debug": {
      "artefact": { ... },
      "excludedPaths": [ ... ],
      "removeSourceFolders": [ ... ],
      "addSourceFolders": [],
      "removeSymbols": [],
      "addSymbols": [],
      "addIncludeFolders": [],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [],
      "common": { ... },
      "tools": { ... }
    },
    "release": {
      "artefact": { ... },
      "excludedPaths": [],
      "removeSourceFolders": [],
      "addSourceFolders": [],
      "removeSymbols": [],
      "addSymbols": [],
      "addIncludeFolders": [],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [],
      "common": { ... },
      "tools": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

The `excludedPaths` array defines folders and/or files that should
not be part of the build, for a specific profile.

Profile names are user defined strings.

## Folder/file specific metadata

The definitions in the top `xmake.json` file apply to all files that enter
the build.

However it is possible to enter specific definitions for folders, and
in this case they apply for all files in the folder, or for a specific file.

Two kinds of data can be defined:
- for source folders, a list of exclusions (folders and/or files)
- for source folders/files, possible different compiler settings.

The folder/file settings are not kept in the top file, but are distributed
in each folder, with file paths local to the folder.

```json
{
  "sourceFolderSettings": {
    "excludedPaths": [],
    "removeSymbols": [],
    "addSymbols": [],
    "removeIncludeFolders": [],
    "addIncludeFolders": [],
    "targets": { ... }
  },
  "sourceFilesSettings": {
    "xyzFilePath1": {
      "removeSymbols": [],
      "addSymbols": [],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [],
      "addIncludeFolders": [],
      "targets": { ... }
    },
    "xyzFilePath2": {
      "removeSymbols": [],
      "addSymbols": [],
      "removeIncludeFolders": [],
      "addIncludeFolders": [],
      "targets": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

## Excluded paths

Type" array of strings.

The `excludedPaths` array defines folders and/or files that should
not be part of the build, for all configurations or for a specific
configuration.

```json
{
  "excludedPaths": [
    "mem1.c",
    "mem3.c"
  ]
}
```

Excluded paths are relative to the current folder, and should refer only to
files/folders in the current folder (in other words, a folder should
not define exclusion from a child folder).

## TODO

- add linker definitions
- add pre/post actions
