The [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file is
basically the same as for npm, with some
extensions.

## The mandatory `xpack` property

To identify a npm package as an xPack, it must have an `xpack`
property, even empty:

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "xpack": {}
}
```

Although not mandatory, it is also recommended to add an `xpack` keyword,
to help find the xPacks in the public repository.

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "keywords": [
    "xpack",
    "..."
  ],
  "xpack": {}
}
```

## The `binaries` property

Binary xPacks do not include the binaries, they include only URLs where
to download the binaries from, and checksums to validate the downloads.

These information are stored in the `xpack` property of `package.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "@xpack-dev-tool/openocd",
  "version": "0.10.0-12.1",
  "description": "A binary xPack with OpenOCD",

{% include note.html content="The names are exactly the Node.js
`process.platform` and `process.arch`." %}

The files are downloaded from `<baseUrl>/<fileName>`. The common
use case is to have all files in the same folder, and in this case it is
enough to define `baseUrl` once, but it is also possible to define it
for each platform, allowing to download files from different folders/servers.

The archives are unpacked in the `destination` folder, defined as relative
to the package root folder (usually `./.content`).

To shorten the paths, a number of the initial levels are skipped (`skip`).

When installing packages as dependencies of an xPack,
after the archive is unpacked, links to each binaries defined
in the `bin` section are created in the `xpacks/.bin` folder.
On Windows, where soft links to files are problematic, `.cmd`
stubs are created.

{% include important.html content="To accommodate for the `.cmd` stubs,
programs launching the executables should do this via a `cmd.exe` shell." %}
