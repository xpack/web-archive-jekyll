## Overview

**xpm** stands for **x**Pack **p**roject **m**anager and is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to manage xPack projects; it can:

- install source and binary packages
- manage multiple build configurations
- execute (multi-)command line actions
- manage properties and perform complex substitutions, using the
  [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com) engine

**xpm** complements **npm** and shares the same public
packages repository ([npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)).

The open source project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack/xpm-js`](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-js.git).

It is available as [xpm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm) from npmjs.com
public registry and can be installed via **npm**.

### Examples

An example of a representative project using **xpm** to manage multi-platform
test is
[@micro-os-plus/utils-lists](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack);
please check the
[package.json](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/utils-lists-xpack/blob/xpack/package.json)
file.

## xPacks overview

xPacks are general purpose multi-version software packages, built on top
of the highly successful npm packages in the Node.js JavaScript ecosystem.

Please read the [xPacks Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/) the
[xPack 101]({{ site.baseurl }}/intro/) pages.

## Purpose

The main purpose of the `xpm` CLI tool is to automate builds, including
to install dependencies, and to easily update them when new versions are
released.

## xpm CLI commands

- [`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/)
- [`xpm init`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/init/)
- [`xpm install`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/install/)
- [`xpm link`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/link/)
- [`xpm list`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/list/)
- [`xpm run`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/run/)
- [`xpm uninstall`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/cli/uninstall/)

Planned:

- `xpm outdated`
- `xpm update`
- `xpm cache`

For publishing and other common operation, use **npm**:

- [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version/)
- [`npm publish`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish/)
- [`npm pack`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-pack/)
- [`npm deprecate`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-deprecate/)
- [`npm publish`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-unpublish/)
- etc...
