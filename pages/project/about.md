## Motto

{% include callout.html content="_Perfekt ist nicht gut genug._" type="primary" %}

Some time ago, while watching a TV documentary about Porsche, I heard
this line and I liked it. If this is indeed one of the Porsche mottos,
then thank you Porsche for it (and for the beautiful designs).
(English: _"Perfect is not good enough"_)

## The project

The **xPack** project received its name in 2017, but it actually originated
in 2012, when it was named **xcdl**, and a Python experimental implementation
of the **eCos CDL** was written.

## The web site

The **xPack** project web site was created in October 2017, using a home
grown GitHub-like theme; however, for a while there was not much content.

In June 2019 it was reworked to use a
more elaborated theme, [Jekyll Doc Theme 6.0](https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/) by [Tom Johnson](https://github.com/tomjoht).
