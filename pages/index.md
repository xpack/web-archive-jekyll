## Mission statement

In short: help developers manage dependencies and multi-configuration builds.

Based on a simple multi-version dependencies manager
(built on top of **npm**),
the xPack project aims to provide a set of cross-platform tools
to manage, configure and build complex,
modular, multi-target (multi-architecture, multi-board, multi-toolchain)
projects, in a reproducible way, with an emphasis on **C/C++** and
bare-metal embedded projects.

The expected benefits are more efficient **code sharing** and
**reusing** during the life cycle of libraries and applications.

## xPacks overview

_Did you ever face the situation when building a perfectly fine and
functional project suddenly failed after
upgrading the system? If so, xPacks may help you._

**xPacks** are general purpose versioned software projects,
built on top of the highly successful
[npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)
in the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) JavaScript ecosystem.
**xPacks** do not introduce a new package format, but use
exactly the same format as **npm packages**, and can be
stored in the same repositories.

By design the xPacks tools are **multi-version**, which means
not only that packages can have
multiple versions, but they **can be installed in parallel**, each
project/configuration having its own set of dependencies,
thus upgrading the system no longer impacts the project.

{% include note.html content="[Nix](https://nixos.org) also provides reproducible builds,
why not use it? The short answer is... _\"because of Windows\"_." %}

Although the current focus is on **C/C++**, most of the tools are
language agnostic
and can be used with other programming languages as well.

{% include note.html content="Most of the tools are generic and do not
mandate the use of a package manager; the binary xPacks are plain archives
that can be extracted manually; the source xPacks can be linked to
projects as Git submodules, etc; they all can be used in traditional
environments too, just that this requires more work." %}

Based on the installed content, there are currently two
types of xPacks: **source** and **binary**:

- **source xPacks** are packages that install source files,
generally libraries
- **binary xPacks** are packages that install binary/executable files,
generally tools used during the build process, like toolchains,
builders, etc.

For more details, read the [xPack 101]({{ site.baseurl }}/intro/) page.

The entire xPack project is split amongst several groups,
published as separated GitHub _organisations_
([xpack](https://github.com/xpack/),
[xpack-dev-tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/),
[micro-os-plus](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/),
[xpack-3rd-party](https://github.com/xpack-3rd-party)).

## xPack Core Tools

The core xPack tools are:

- [`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/) - the **xPack Project Manager**

Planned:

- `@xpack/xpmake` - the **xPack Project Builder**
- `@xpack/xpliquid` - the **xPack Liquid Template Engine**
- `@xpack/xpjson` - the **xPack JSON Manager**
- `@xpack/xpninja` - the **xPack Build Runner**

These projects are hosted in the GitHub
[`xpack`](https://github.com/xpack/) organization.

## xPack Binary Development Tools

There are more than 20 binary tools, each with their own project
(hosted in the GitHub
[`xpack-dev-tools`](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools) organization)
and their own web site.

An index is available as:

- [xPack Binary Development Tools](https://xpack-dev-tools.github.io)

## Visual Studio Code

Support for VS Code is provided via the
[xPack extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/vscode/). This extension allows to
navigate through the project **xPack actions**, and run them with a click of
the mouse; it can also create new projects using the
**xPack project templates**.

## Eclipse

[Eclipse Embedded CDT](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io)
can be configured to use the
[xPack binary tools](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/) during **builds**
(the Arm & RISC-V embedded toolchains) and during the **debug sessions**
(OpenOCD and QEMU);
it also uses some **xPack project templates** to create Eclipse
[projects](https://eclipse-embed-cdt.github.io/templates/hello-world-qemu-xpack/).
