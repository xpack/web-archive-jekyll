## Quicklinks

The quick answer is to use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap-xpack/discussions/).

## Check the documentation

The current version specific XBB Bootstrap documentation is available online from:

- [https://www.winehq.org/](https://www.winehq.org/)

## Check the FAQ

Check the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}/xbb-bootstrap/faq/)
for similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Discussions

Check the GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap-xpack/discussions/) for
similar problems.

## Check the GitHub Issues

Check the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap-xpack/issues/)
tracker for similar problems.

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap-xpack/discussions/),
and enter a **New discussion** in the **Q&A** category.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug related to the binary
distribution, not XBB Bootstrap itself (if you have doubts, use the GitHub Discussions),
or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance the **xPack XBB Bootstrap**
distribution, register a **New Issue** in the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap-xpack/issues/)
tracker.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support, **use the GitHub Discussions**." %}

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xbb-bootstrap-xpack/discussions/)**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
