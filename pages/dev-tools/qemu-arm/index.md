## Deprecated qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse

Starting with 2022, the custom QEMU known as `qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse`,
used initially with Eclipse, was
[deprecated]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-arm/gnuarmeclipse/),
and the project was updated to use the current upstream sources.

For compatibility reasons, `qemu-system-gnuarmeclipse` will still be
available for a while, but it is no longer recommended for new projects.

## Why QEMU?

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) is the long-standing open-source
cross-platform emulator. It is mature, it provides a good framework
for emulation, it implements a GDB server, it provides support for
semihosting, and although it does not intend to accurately simulate
processor time behaviour, it does keep a quite accurate track of
time when emulating timer interrupts, so it can also be used to
emulate applications using RTOS-es.

## Overview

**xPack QEMU Arm** is a cross-platform binary distribution of
the public open-source
[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) project.

## Benefits

The main benefits of using the **xPack QEMU Arm** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure,
  the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (Intel Windows 64-bit, Intel GNU/Linux 64-bit, Arm GNU/Linux
  64/32-bit, Intel macOS 64-bit, Apple Silicon macOS 64-bit)
- a better integration with development environments
  like **Eclipse Embedded CDT**;
  users can run the _Hello World_ projects generated by the
  Eclipse templates immediately, without any specific hardware,
  neither development board nor JTAG programmer; all debugging
  features, like single stepping, inspecting variables, registers,
  etc. are supported
- a convenient integration with Continuous Integration environments,
  like GitHub Actions; the emulator provides a very convenient platform for running
  **unit tests**, fully supporting the **semihosting** features
  required for this.

All binaries are self-contained, they include all required libraries,
and can be installed in any location.

### Compatibility & peripherals

The xPack QEMU Arm is fully compatible with the original
`qemu-system-arm` and `qemu-system-aarch64`.

**xPack QEMU Arm** is generally intended for running tests, mainly
**unit tests**.

## Semihosting and ITM

The recommended method to display messages from the target is via
semihosting.

## Documentation

The official QEMU documentation is available
[online](https://wiki.qemu.org/Manual).

## Install

The details of installing the **xPack QEMU Arm** on various platforms are
presented in a dedicated
[install]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-arm/install) page.

## Testing

The recommended method to test QEMU is using the new Eclipse QEMU Arm Debugging
plug-in; create a test project using the _Hello World_ project template.

## Support

For the various support options, please read the separate
[support]({{ site.baseurl }}/qemu-arm/support/) page.
