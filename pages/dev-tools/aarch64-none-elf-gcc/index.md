## Overview

The **xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC**
is an alternate binary distribution that complements the official
[GNU AArch64 Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)
maintained by Arm.

## Benefits

The main advantages of using the **xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC** are:

- a convenient, uniform and portable install/uninstall/upgrade procedure,
  the same procedure is used for all major
  platforms (Intel Windows 64-bit, Intel GNU/Linux 64-bit, Arm GNU/Linux
  64/32-bit, Intel macOS 64-bit, Apple Silicon macOS 64-bit)
- a convenient integration with Continuous Integration environments,
  like GitHub Actions
- a better integration with development environments
  like **Eclipse Embedded CDT**.

All binaries are self-contained, they include all required libraries,
and can be installed in any location.

## Compatibility

The **xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC** is fully compatible with the
original GNU AArch64 Embedded Toolchain distribution by Arm.

Occasionally, when bugs are discovered and the yearly Arm release schedule
would add unacceptably long delays, the **xPack GNU AArch64 Embedded GCC**
moves ahead of Arm and uses more recent tools versions that fix the bugs.
