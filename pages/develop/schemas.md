## Schemas

Although originally JSONs were intended only as an exchange format
between JavaScript applications, and not requiring methods of validation,
once their use spread to manually written configuration files, third parties
designed methods equivalent to XML schemas.

In the xPack project, currently the following JSON schemas are available:

- [xbuild v0.3.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/schemas/xbuild-0.3.0.json) (work in progress)
- [xpdsc v0.3.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/schemas/xpdsc-0.3.0.json) (work in progress)
- [xsvd v0.1.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/schemas/xsvd-0.1.0.json) (work in progress)

Other schema resources:

- [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org) - the specifications
