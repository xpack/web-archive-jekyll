## Tools issues

In case you encounter problems while using the xPack tools, please
consider the following:

- read carefully the documentation pages
- check the release pages for **Known issues**
- check the **FAQ** pages
- check the GitHub Discussions for the specific project
- check the GitHub Issues for the specific project

## Ask questions in GitHub Discussions

If you still could not find a solution, if you have interesting use
cases, if you have custom configurations, and generally if you have
any experience that you want to share with others, please use the
GitHub Discussions.

## Discuss live in the chat room

For live discussions between users, you can use the
[xPack chatroom](https://gitter.im/xpack/community).
This may be a great way to share experience, but **for support
the Discussions are preferred**.

## Register a new support ticket only if necessary

If you are convinced that you identified a bug (if you have doubts,
use GitHub Discussions), or you have a pertinent suggestion how to enhance
the xPack tools, please use the specific GitHub Issues trackers.

{% include tip.html content="**DO NOT** use the GitHub Issues tracker
for questions and support, **use GitHub Discussions**." %}

## Use of the Disqus comments

Most web pages have a **Disqus** comments section at the bottom.
Comments and clarifications **on the content of the web page** that
might be **useful for other readers** are welcomed there.

For question and general support, please use the GitHub Discussions.

## Web pages issues

If you discover problems in the content of these pages (typos,
wrong phrasing, etc), or you have suggestions on how to improve the
documentation,
you can fork the
[web-jekyll.git project](https://github.com/xpack/web-jekyll/pulls/)
and send a **Pull Request**, or use the GitHub
[Issues](https://github.com/xpack/web-jekyll/issues/) tracker.

## Use of private e-mail

{% include important.html content="Please, please, please: **do not use
private e-mail** for support, **use the GitHub Discussions**." %}

Sending private messages will be automatically replied with
a link to this page.
The reason for this rude behaviour is simply an attempt to use
the time more efficiently; since Discussions are archived, other people
having similar problems might benefit from the answers.
