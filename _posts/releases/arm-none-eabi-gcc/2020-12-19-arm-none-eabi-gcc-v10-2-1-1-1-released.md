The [xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC](https://xpack.github.io/dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/)
is the **xPack** distribution of the
[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64 and x86),
**macOS** (x64) and **GNU/Linux** (x64 and x86, arm64 and arm).

{% include note.html content="The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported)." %}

## Download

The binary files are available from [GitHub Releases]({{ page.download_url }}).

{% include note.html content="For consistency with the Node.js naming conventions, the names of the 32-bit x86 images are now suffixed with `-ia32`." %}

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GNU Arm Embedded GCC** on
various platforms are presented in the separate [Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc/install/) page.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GNU Arm Embedded GCC is with
[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

To install the latest version available, use:

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@latest --verbose
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc@{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }}
```

## Compliance

- [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm)

## Changes

Compared to the official Arm version, there should be no functional changes.

Starting with 9.x, the new archives are created with
a single folder named `xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.1-1.1` instead of
the hierarchical `xPacks/arm-none-eabi-gcc/10.2.1-1.1`. This internal
folder name is used consistently on all platforms. The archive extension
was changed to `.tar.gz`.

With these changes, the archives can now be used directly in other
development environments (like Arduino), without having to repack them.

### Python

Support for Python scripting was added to GDB. This distribution provides
a separate binary, `arm-none-eabi-gdb-py3` with
support for **Python 3.7**.

The Python 3 run-time is included, so GDB does not need any version of
Python to be installed, and is insensitive to the presence of other
versions.

Support for Python 2 was discontinued.

### Text User Interface (TUI)

Support for TUI was added to GDB. The `ncurses` library (v6.2) was added to
the distribution.

{% include note.html content="TUI is not available on Windows." %}

## Bug fixes

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally in the
same folder as the executable.

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep rpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library runpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, used `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and does not tolerate setting
it in the environment.

### `@executable_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the binaries are adjusted with `otool` to use a
relative path.

## Documentation

The original PDF documentation is available in the `share/doc` folder.

## Supported platforms

Binaries for **Windows**, **macOS** and **GNU/Linux** are provided.

The binaries were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 16 Docker container (added in mid-2020)
- x86/x64 Windows: all binaries were built with mingw-w64 GCC 9.3, running in an
  Ubuntu 12 Docker container
- x64 macOS: all binaries were built with GCC 9.3, running in a separate
  folder on macOS 10.10.5.

## Build

The scripts used to build this distribution are in:

- `distro-info/scripts`

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-MAINTAINER.md) page.

## Travis tests

The first set of tests were performed on Travis, by running
a simple script to check if the binaries start and compile several simple
programs on a wide range of platforms and distributions:

- [test xPack Arm Embed GCC on stable platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/750532512)
- [test xPack Arm Embed GCC on latest platforms](https://travis-ci.org/github/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/builds/750532548)

## Tests

The binaries were testes on Windows 10 Pro 32/64-bit, Ubuntu 18 LTS 64-bit,
Xubuntu 18 LTS 32-bit and macOS 10.13.

The tests consist in building and debugging some
[simple Eclipse projects](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc-xpack/tree/xpack/tests/eclipse)
available in the project.

Since the source code used for GCC is identical to the one used by Arm, the
long and complex tests performed by Arm to validate their release were not
executed again.
