The [xPack GCC](https://xpack.github.io/gcc/)
is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org).

There are separate binaries for **Windows** (x64),
**macOS** (x64, arm64)
and **GNU/Linux** (x64, arm64 and arm).

{% include note.html content="The main targets for the GNU/Linux Arm
binaries are the **Raspberry Pi** class devices (armv7l and aarch64;
armv6 is not supported)." %}

<MacOsClt16Issue/>

## Download

The binary files are available from [GitHub Releases]({{ page.download_url }}).

## Prerequisites

- x64 GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: any system with **GLIBC 2.27** or higher
  (like Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu 18 or later, Debian 10 or later, RedHat 8 or later,
  Fedora 29 or later, etc)
- x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c)),
  Windows 8, Windows 10
- x64 macOS: 10.13 or later
- arm64 macOS: 11.6 or later

## Install

The full details of installing the **xPack GCC** on various platforms
are presented in the separate [Install]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/gcc/install/) page.

### Easy install

The easiest way to install GCC is with
[`xpm`]({{ site.baseurl }}/xpm/)
by using the **binary xPack**, available as
[`@xpack-dev-tools/gcc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpack-dev-tools/gcc)
from the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com) registry.

With the `xpm` tool available, installing
the latest version of the package and adding it as
a development dependency for a project is quite easy:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Add a package.json if not already present

xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/gcc@latest --verbose

ls -l xpacks/.bin
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install @xpack-dev-tools/gcc@{{ page.version }}.{{ page.npm_subversion }} --verbose
```

It is also possible to install GCC globally, in the user home folder,
but this requires xPack aware tools to automatically identify them and
manage paths.

```sh
xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/gcc@latest --verbose
```

### Uninstall

To remove the links created by xpm in the current project:

```sh
cd my-project

xpm uninstall @xpack-dev-tools/gcc
```

To completely remove the package from the central xPack store:

```sh
xpm uninstall --global @xpack-dev-tools/gcc
```

## Compliance

The xPack GCC generally follows the official
[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html) releases.

The current version is based on:

- GCC version [13.3.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-13/) from May 21, 2024;
- binutils version
[2.42](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2024-01/msg00016.html)
from Jan 29, 2024.

## Supported languages

The supported languages are:

- C
- C++
- Obj-C
- Obj-C++
- Fortran

Note: Obj-C/C++ support is minimalistic.

Starting with 12.2.0-2, support for 32-bit multilib was added on x86
GNU/Linux; it can be enabled via the `-m32` compile option.

## Changes

Compared to the upstream, there are no functional changes.

## Bug fixes

- none

## Enhancements

- none

## Known problems

Please see the separate
[tests results page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev-tools/gcc/tests/13.3.0-1/).

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally
in the `libexec` folder (or in the same folder as the executable for Windows).

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep runpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library rpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, used `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and does not tolerate setting
it in the environment.

### `@rpath` and `@loader_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the binaries are adjusted with `install_name_tool` to use a
relative path.

## Documentation

To save space and bandwidth, the original GNU GCC documentation is available
[online](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/).

## Build

The binaries for all supported platforms
(Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux) were built using the
[xPack Build Box (XBB)](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/), a set
of build environments based on slightly older distributions, that should be
compatible with most recent systems.

For the prerequisites and more details on the build procedure, please see the
[How to build](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/blob/xpack/README-BUILD.md) page.

## CI tests

Before publishing, a set of simple tests were performed on an exhaustive
set of platforms. The results are available from:

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/actions/)
- [Travis CI](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/xpack-dev-tools/gcc-xpack/builds/)

## Tests

The binaries were tested on a variety of platforms,
but mainly to check the integrity of the
build, not the compiler functionality.

## Deprecation notices

### GNU/Linux minimum requirements

The minimum requirement is **GLIBC 2.27**, available starting
with Ubuntu 18, Debian 10 and RedHat 8.
Support for RedHat 7 was dropped in 2022.

### 32-bit support

Support for 32-bit x86 GNU/Linux and x86 Windows was
dropped in 2022.

### Pre-deprecation notice for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux

Due to the large user base of 32-bit Raspberry Pi systems,
Support for 32-bit Arm GNU/Linux (armv7l) will be preserved
for a little while, but expect it to be dropped by 2025,
so it is recommended to consider an upgrade to a RPi 4 or 5 with
at least 4 GB (preferably 8 GB) of RAM.

## Pre-deprecation notice for Ubuntu 18.04

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS _Bionic Beaver_ reached the end of the standard five-year
maintenance window for Long-Term Support (LTS) release on 31 May 2023.

As a courtesy, the xPack GNU/Linux releases will continue to be based on
Ubuntu 18.04 for another year.

From 2025 onwards, the GNU/Linux binaries will be built on **Debian 10**,
(**GLIBC 2.28**), and are also expected to run on RedHat 8.

Users are urged to update their build and test infrastructure to
ensure a smooth transition to the next xPack releases.
