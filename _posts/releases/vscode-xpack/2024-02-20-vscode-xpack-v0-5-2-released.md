## Install

The **VS Code xPack C/C++ Managed Build Extension** is
available as **ilg-vscode.xpack** from the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack).

It can also be installed from a terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension ilg-vscode.xpack
```

This specific version can be installed with the following command,
although generally it is recommended to use the latest version:

```sh
code --install-extension ilg-vscode.xpack@{{ page.version }}
```

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

### Bug fixes

  it ended with a CRLF; fixed.

### Known problems

## Supported platforms

The **ilg-vscode.xpack** extension is fully portable and works on any
platform supported by VS Code; internally it relies on **xpm**, which
is also a portable application running on all platforms supported
by **npm**/**node**.

However, for projects using binary xPacks, they are available mainly
on the modern platforms, like Windows/macOS/Linux.
