## Install

The **VS Code xPack C/C++ Managed Build Extension** is
available as **ilg-vscode.xpack** from the

It can also be installed from a terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension ilg-vscode.xpack

This specific version can be installed with the following command,
although generally it is recommended to use the latest version:

## Supported platforms

The **ilg-vscode.xpack** extension is fully portable and works on any
platform supported by VS Code; internally it relies on **xpm**, which
is also a portable application running on all platforms supported
by **npm**/**node**.

However, for projects using binary xPacks, they are available mainly
on the modern platforms, like Windows/macOS/Linux.
