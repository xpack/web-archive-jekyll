## Install

The **VS Code xPack C/C++ Managed Build Extension** is
available as **ilg-vscode.xpack** from the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack).

It can also be installed from a terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension ilg-vscode.xpack
```

This specific version can be installed with the following command,
although generally it is recommended to use the latest version:

```sh
code --install-extension ilg-vscode.xpack@0.4.16
```

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

### Bug fixes

- [#22] - due to a bug in the logic to redraw the xPack Actions tree, after
  editing the `package.json`, all attempts to perform any actions via the
  play icon failed with an error
  (_Error running command xpack.runAction: Running the contributed
  command: 'xpack.runAction' failed. This is likely caused by the extension
  that contributes xpack.runAction._). Possible workarounds were to
  close/reopen the project, or to restart VS Code.
  The problem was caused by a member of the `TreeDataProvider` class which,
  in a previous release, was erroneously renamed. The name was reverted to
  `onDidChangeTreeData`, and this fixed the bug.
  Many thanks to Erich Styger for helping identify this bug.

## Supported platforms

The **ilg-vscode.xpack** extension is fully portable and works on any
platform supported by VS Code; internally it relies on **xpm**, which
is also a portable application running on all platforms supported
by **npm**/**node**.

However, for projects using binary xPacks, they are available mainly
on the modern platforms, like Windows/macOS/Linux.
