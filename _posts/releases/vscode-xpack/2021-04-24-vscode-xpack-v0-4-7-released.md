## Install

The **VS Code xPack C/C++ Managed Build Extension** is
available as **ilg-vscode.xpack** from the
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ilg-vscode.xpack).

It can also be installed from a terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension ilg-vscode.xpack@0.4.7
```

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

### Bug fixes

- [#9] - fix package.json watcher concurrency

### Enhancements

- [#10] - add watcher to update c_cpp_properties.json

### Other changes

- package.json: use extensionDependencies & qna
- the README.md was reworked to refer to the project web

### Known problems

- **npm** picks `package.json` from xPack dependencies, which is generally
  not useful; the workaround is to add a property to `settings.json`:

```json
"npm.exclude": "**/xpacks/**"
```

(fixed in 0.4.10)

## Supported platforms

The **ilg-vscode.xpack** extension is fully portable and works on any
platform supported by VS Code; internally it relies on **xpm**, which
is also a portable application running on all platforms supported
by **npm**/**node**.

However, for projects using binary xPacks, they are available mainly
on the modern platforms, like Windows/macOS/Linux.

## Final notes

is currently _work in progress_ and should be used with caution." %}
