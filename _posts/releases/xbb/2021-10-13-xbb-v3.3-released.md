The xPack Build Box (XBB) is a build environment intended for reproducible builds.

## Supported platforms

XBB supports building binaries for the following platforms:

- Intel GNU/Linux 64/32-bit
- Arm GNU/Linux 64/32-bit
- Intel macOS 64-bit
- Intel Windows 64/32-bit

Windows binaries are built on GNU/Linux, using mingw-w64.

## Compatibility

To allow the resulting binaries to run on as many existing systems
as possible, the XBB build environments are on purpose based on older
GNU/Linux and macOS releases:

- x86/x64 GNU/Linux: Ubuntu 12.04 with **GLIBC 2.15**; this should provide compatibility with:
  - Ubuntu 12 or later
  - Debian 8 or later
  - RedHat/CentOS 7 later
  - Fedora 20 or later
  - any other distributions using GLIBC 2.15 or higher
- arm64/arm GNU/Linux: Ubuntu 16.04 with **GLIBC 2.23**; this should provide compatibility with:
  - Ubuntu 16 or later
  - Debian 9 or later
  - RedHat/CentOS 8 or later
  - Fedora 24 or later
  - any other distributions using GLIBC 2.23 or higher
- x86/x64 Windows: Windows 7 with the new Universal C Runtime
  ([UCRT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-for-universal-c-runtime-in-windows-c0514201-7fe6-95a3-b0a5-287930f3560c))
- x64 macOS: 10.13; this should provide compatibility with:
  - macOS 10.13 or later

{% include note.html content="The Intel macOS builds
use `-mmacosx-version-min=10.10`, which configures the resulting
binaries to run on macOS 10.10 or later; however the toolchain packages
(like GCC and clang) require the Command Line Tools to be present in
`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`, and this is available only since
macOS 10.13; so, except the toolchains, the other binaries may also
run on macOS 10.10 or later." %}

### GLIBC version

To find out the GLIBC version on a given GNU/Linux distribution, use:

```sh
ldd --version
```

## Tools versions

In version 3.3, the main tools provided by XBB were updated to:

- GCC 11.2.0
- binutils 2.36.1
- mingw-w64 9.0.0
- m4 1.4.18
- gawk 5.1.0
- sed 4.8
- autoconf 2.71
- automake 1.16.3
- make 4.3
- perl 5.32.0
- cmake 3.20.6

For the full list of available tools, see the
[common-versions-xbb-source.sh](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box/blob/master/helper/common-versions-xbb-source.sh) file.

## GNU/Linux Docker images

On GNU/Linux, the production XBB consists of multiple Docker images,
in pairs of 32/64-bit, for each platform and version.

The images are published on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ilegeul/ubuntu)
(pulling can be done anonymously, pushing requires login).

Intel GNU/Linux:

- `ilegeul/ubuntu:amd64-12.04-xbb-v3.3`
- `ilegeul/ubuntu:i386-12.04-xbb-v3.3`

```console
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                    IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ilegeul/ubuntu      i386-12.04-xbb-v3.3    35fb0236572c        23 hours ago        5GB
ilegeul/ubuntu      amd64-12.04-xbb-v3.3   1c4ba2e7e87e        29 hours ago        5.43GB
```

For projects that do not require compatibility with systems that old,
images based on Ubuntu 18 are also available:

- `ilegeul/ubuntu:amd64-18.04-xbb-v3.3`
- `ilegeul/ubuntu:i386-18.04-xbb-v3.3`

The images were created on a Debian 10
running on an Intel NUC.

Arm GNU/Linux:

- `ilegeul/ubuntu:arm64v8-16.04-xbb-v3.3`
- `ilegeul/ubuntu:arm32v7-16.04-xbb-v3.3`

```console
REPOSITORY       TAG                      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
ilegeul/ubuntu   arm32v7-16.04-xbb-v3.3   a0ceaa6dad05   57 minutes ago   3.34GB
ilegeul/ubuntu   arm64v8-16.04-xbb-v3.3   1b0b4a94de6d   13 hours ago     3.6GB
```

For projects that do not require compatibility with systems that old,
images based on Ubuntu 18 are also available:

- `ilegeul/ubuntu:arm64v8-18.04-xbb-v3.3`
- `ilegeul/ubuntu:arm32v7-18.04-xbb-v3.3`

The images were created on a Raspberry Pi OS
running on a Raspberry CM4 with 8 GB RAM.

## macOS

When running on macOS, the build scripts cannot use Docker, since there
are no macOS Docker images; instead,
a custom set of tools is expected in a specific folder
(like `${HOME}/.local/xbb`),
which includes the same tools as packed in the Docker images.

### Command Line Tools

As usual with macOS, the compiler and other development tools are not
packed in the base system and need to be installed separately as part of the
**Command Line Tools** package, available from
[Apple](https://developer.apple.com).

The XBB binaries expect the CLT binary tools to be present in a
fixed location, which is:

- `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin`

## TeX

All platforms include an instance of the 2018 TeX Live tools.
