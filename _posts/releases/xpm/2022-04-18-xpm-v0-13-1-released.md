**xpm** is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to manage
[xPacks](https://xpack.github.io/intro/#but-what-are-xpacks) dependencies.

## Install

**xpm** is a Node.js module that can be installed with `npm`.

For the prerequisites, since it is recommended
to use a version manager or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

To install the **latest stable** version available, use:

```sh
npm uninstall --global xpm
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global xpm@{{ page.version }}
```

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

The main change is adding support for inheritance in build configurations,
to reduce redundancy in related (debug/release) configurations.

This is achieved by using the `inherit` property; for example:

```json
      "native-cmake-release": {
        "inherit": [
          "native-cmake-debug"
        ],
        "properties": {
          "buildType": "Release"
        }
      }
```

### Bug fixes

- [#133] by design, the content of the packages installed in the central
  store is expected to be read only; due to a `node` documentation
  issue, changing file mode to R/O on Windows was not effective; fixed

### Enhancements

- [#134] implement buildConfiguration inheritance
- [#135] add `--ignore-errors` to `run` & `install` to allow scripts
  to continue
- [#136] when referring to a non existent configuration, a stack
  trace was shown; fixed
- [#131] improve error message to suggest `--global`

### Other changes

- [#109] prefer `XPACKS_STORE_FOLDER` over `XPACKS_REPO_FOLDER`

### Known problems

- [#57] when multiple versions of the same package are referenced
  via different dependencies paths, the program fails; version
  mitigation will be implemented in a future release.

## Documentation

The program interprets `--help` and displays a top help page:
