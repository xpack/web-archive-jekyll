**xpm** is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to manage
[xPacks](https://xpack.github.io/intro/#but-what-are-xpacks) dependencies.

## Install

**xpm** is a Node.js module that can be installed with `npm`.

For the prerequisites, since it is recommended
to use a version manager or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

To install the **latest stable** version available, use:

```sh
npm uninstall --global xpm
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global xpm@{{ page.version }}
```

{% include note.html content="In the current configuration,
**npm** complains about several deprecated packages;
until these third party packages will be updated,
in v0.10.2 an workaround was added, by bundling the dependencies." %}

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

The main change is the addition of an extensive set of variables and
filters to the Liquid substitution engine.

### Bug fixes

- [#104] Attempts to install globally failed if the current folder
  contained a package.json created by npm; the cause was identified
  to be a misplaced validation check; fixed.

### Enhancements

- [#108] support multi-line properties was added
- [#107] the project description was updated to _project manager_
- [#106] a check of `minimumXpmRequired` was added when creating projects
  from templates
- [#105] some error messages were changed, in an attempt to make them
  more explicit
- [#103] when creating projects from templates, if the `bundleDependencies`
  is present, no install is performed
- [#102] projects created via `xpm init` now include `minimumXpmRequired`

### Other changes

- [#101] the `CliExitCodes` & `CliError` were passed in the `context`,
  to be used by templates
- [#99] the Liquid code is now in a separate package, `@xpack/xpm-liquid`;
  it adds an extensive set of variables and filters; for details see project
  [README](https://github.com/xpack/xpm-liquid-ts#readme)
- [#100] the Liquid tag `endl` was removed

### Known problems

- the warnings triggered by third party dependencies during install; fixed in v0.10.2
- [#57] when multiple versions of the same package are referenced
  via different dependencies paths, the program fails; version
  mitigation will be implemented in a future release.
