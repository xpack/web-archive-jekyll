**xpm** stands for **x**Pack **p**roject **m**anager and is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to manage
[xPacks](https://xpack.github.io/intro/#but-what-are-xpacks).

## Install

**xpm** is a Node.js module that can be installed with `npm`.

For the prerequisites, since it is recommended
to use a version manager or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

To install the **latest stable** version available, use:

```sh
npm uninstall --global xpm
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global xpm@{{ page.version }}
```

{% include note.html content="In the current configuration,
**npm** complains about several deprecated packages;
until these third party packages will be updated,
in v0.10.2 an workaround was added, by bundling the
dependencies." %}

## Changes

Except the removed command (`build`), the {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous 0.7.x releases.

### Bug fixes

- [#66] due to a partial implementation,
  installing packages that were not published in the npmjs.com repository,
  directly from Git, GitHub, GitLab, archive or local files, failed; fixed
- [#72] installing standalone packages was done by directly copying
  the content locally; for consistency reasons,the behaviour was changed,
  the content is now also
  installed in the global xPacks store and links are added locally, as
  for any package
- [#70] in certain conditions, if the project `package.json` had no
  name/version properties defined, the program crashed with asserts; a better
  error processing was implemented

### Enhancements

- [#78] installing dependencies proved quite slow; to make things
  faster, dependencies are downloaded in parallel
- [#13] the command `uninstall` was added; it can remove packages
  from the local project or from the central xPacks store (`-g`)
- [#76] the command `list` was added; it can list packages
  installed in the local project or in the central xPacks store (`-g`)
- [#73] with folders from the central xPacks store linked to the local
  project, it was possible to change the content in the central xPacks store,
  thus damaging the packages; to prevent this, now all installed
  packages are changed to read-only, and changed back to read-write
  only before uninstall
- [#60] the default location for installing global packages on Linux
  was changed from `$HOME/opt` to `$HOME/.local`, to better match the
  recommended Linux file system hierarchy
- [#71] the general program verbosity was a bit too high; reduced; for
  first time users it is recommended to add `-v` to increase verbosity
- [#68] in certain conditions, after displaying errors, the program
  continued to output several more lines, making spotting errors more
  difficult; fixed
- [#74] in certain conditions, when the internal links were
  no longer available, the `link` command reported an
  internal error (`ENOENT`), instead of a more user friendly message
  informing about the broken link; fixed

### Other changes

- [#75] the `build` command was removed, its functionality is already
  provided by the more general `run` command

### Known problems

- the warnings triggered by third party dependencies during install; fixed in v0.10.2
- [#57] when multiple versions of the same package are referenced
  via different dependencies paths, the program fails; version
  mitigation will be implemented in a future release.

## Documentation

The program interprets `--help` and displays a top help page:
