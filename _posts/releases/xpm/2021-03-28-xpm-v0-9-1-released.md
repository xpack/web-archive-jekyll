**xpm** is a
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) CLI
application to manage
[xPacks](https://xpack.github.io/intro/#but-what-are-xpacks) dependencies.

## Install

**xpm** is a Node.js module that can be installed with `npm`.

For the prerequisites, since it is recommended
to use a version manager or to customize the **npm** install location,
please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/install/) page for more details.

To install the **latest stable** version available, use:

```sh
npm uninstall --global xpm
npm install --global xpm@latest
```

To install this specific version, use:

```sh
xpm install --global xpm@{{ page.version }}
```

{% include note.html content="In the current configuration,
**npm** complains about several deprecated packages;
until these third party packages will be updated,
in v0.10.2 an workaround was added, by bundling the
dependencies." %}

## Changes

The {{ page.version }} release
is generally compatible with previous releases.

The main change over the previous release is support for multiple
_configurations_, usually _build configurations_,
which are intended to support development for applications using multiple
build folders (like debug/release, but also multi-platform builds).

### Bug fixes

- [#98] when installing tools in the build configuration, the execution
  path was hardcoded to the `build/<configuration-name>` folder; fixed, now
  the execution path reflects the user setting;

### Enhancements

- [#97] the preferred property used to define configurations is now
  `buildConfigurations`, instead of `configurations`;

### Other changes

- none

### Known problems

- the warnings triggered by third party dependencies during install; fixed in v0.10.2
- [#57] when multiple versions of the same package are referenced
  via different dependencies paths, the program fails; version
  mitigation will be implemented in a future release.
